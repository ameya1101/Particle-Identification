# Particle-Identification

This project uses machine learning models to classify the particles produced during an electron-proton inelastic scattering experiment based on their dectector reponses.  

The data is a simplified version of the data produced during a GEANT4 simulation of the scattering. The data was sourced from Kaggle and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/naharrison/particle-identification-from-detector-responses
